This application is designed for use with MLX90640 IR sensors. This program should function the same way as the MLXHeatCam by SparkFun* but without Processing 4 -- which is useful as the most recent Processing update broke the supplied MLXHeatCam program. Similarly, this application retrieves the MLX90640 sensor's thermal data from your microcontroller via Serial USB connection (Arduino, ESP32, etc..) and draws the consequent thermal image while updating and displaying the frame minTemp and maxTemp.

**This web application has been tested with Windows Node.js local hosting and Google Firebase remote app hosting. Web application may still function on your mobile device -- check "Issues"** 

HOW TO LAUNCH:

1) Git clone this repository to a local folder.
2) Open the local directory in terminal.
3) Enter the following Node Package Manager (npm) commands in your terminal window OR use the equivalent commands for alternative package managers:
