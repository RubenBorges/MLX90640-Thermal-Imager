This application is designed for use with MLX90640 IR sensors. This program should function the same way as the MLXHeatCam by SparkFun* but without Processing 4 -- which is useful as the most recent Processing update broke the supplied MLXHeatCam program. Similarly, this application retrieves the MLX90640 sensor's thermal data from your microcontroller via Serial USB connection (Arduino, ESP32, etc..) and draws the consequent thermal image while updating and displaying the frame minTemp and maxTemp.
